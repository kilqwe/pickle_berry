**pickleBerry** is a TUI based file-manager which specifically built for keyboard driven usecase.
It is completly shell based and so is very light weight and still can perform all basic file operations.
It is still required to know basic bash/zsh commands for usage (eg: touch, mkdir, etc).
**pickleBerry** uses dynamic keybindings so to improve usage speed and for a genral better user experience, for example the keybinding `t` can mean diffrent
things under diffrent senarios.
